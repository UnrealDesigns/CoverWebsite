###Advantages/Usage of GIT for Version Control

All developers please read the following article. It gives a good explanation GIT v/s SVN. It also shows a development flow which is quite logical and efficient.

**LINK : [A successful git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)**

Respective branches will be created in a future push

###Development Environment

1. **Operating System** - Personal Choice
		
		Recommended - Unix 

2. **Coding Languages**
		
		Frontend
			* HTML + JavaScript (HTML5 with fallbacks)
			* CSS3 (Fallbacks for non-supported browsers using JavaScript)
			* jQuery 2.0.3 (included)
			* AngularJS - Dynamic Front End
			* SCSS/SASS - Dynamic CSS
		Backend
			* PHP (any stable version 5.3 +)
			* MySQL (any stable version 5.5.x+)

	**REFER** : [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org)
	**REFER** : [SASS](http://sass-lang.com)

3. **Website Heirarchy**
	
		All web developers are required to use Angular JS. 
		This will keep this website MVC oriented which will be scaleable quite easily. 
		It will get everyone in the flow for future development on iOS and Android.

		Folders and locations should be self explanatory.
		
##All the best !
